HERO BACKGROUND IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS
===================================

To add your hero background image:

1. Place your image file in this directory (/public)
2. Name it: hero-bg.png (or hero-bg.jpg)
3. Recommended specs:
   - Dimensions: 1920x1080 or higher
   - Format: PNG or JPG
   - Size: Keep under 500KB for fast loading
   - Style: Should work well with dark overlay (60% black)

Current implementation:
- Located in: components/landing/hero.tsx
- Image path: /hero-bg.png
- Has gradient overlay to ensure text readability
- Opacity set to 30%

To change the image path, edit line 15 in components/landing/hero.tsx:
  src="/hero-bg.png"  <- Change this to your image filename
